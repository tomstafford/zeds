python3 script for finding/loading zed's pages. Speeds up your weekly shop

looks in the file `shopping.csv` for items and either searches for them or, if there is a url, loads that page

run at the command line

    python zeds.py

you can then click "add to basket"

conda environment environment.yml will ensure you have the right library versions etc but it doesn't rely on anything fancy so it should work ok without as long as you have python 3

Not licensed, endorsed, the responsibility of, etc Zeds in any way!
